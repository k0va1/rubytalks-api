# How to contribute?

You can contribute in several ways:
* Report a bug
* Suggest a feature
* Fix existing bug
* Implement approved feature
* Fix typos
* Improve test coverage of project

All available bugs and features you can find on [issues](https://github.com/saintprug/rubytalks.org/issues) page.
If you don't know which issue to take, please consider one with label `good first issue`. When you start working
on something it will be great to leave a comment. This is how other contributors will know that issue in in progress.

## Contribution workflow

1. Fork the project
2. Find Feature or Bug in Github issues
3. Implement the solution
4. Write tests
5. Create Pull Request
6. Ensure that build is green

## Issue Guidelines

All issues available for community contributions are marked with `help wanted` label.

### Reporting bugs

If you found a bug, report an issue and describe what's the expected behavior versus what actually happens.
If the bug causes a crash, attach a full backtrace. All bugs are marked with label `bug`.

### Reporting feature requests

If you have an idea about some feature, please open an issue. We will discuss all details and if it's really
useful add `feature` label. After that it'll be ready for development.
